# UTAB Module 1 Challenge 

In this project I was tasked with refactoring HTML and CSS code. The task I was given was to meet the acceptance crietera while maintaining the design and functionality of the page. The user story and acceptance criteria are as follows: 

User Story:

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

Acceptance Criteria: 

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Starter Code

The HTML and CSS starter files which were provided are located [here](https://github.com/AndreaRene/Module_1_Challenge/tree/main/Starter_Code). Some of the issues are as follows:

* The starter HTML code was missing numerous semantic elements and was not optimized for accessibility. 
* The CSS code had repeating selectors and properties which needed to be consildated and organized. 
* The webpage had a broken link which needed to be fixed.

### An example of the starter code:

## Refactored Code

My refactored HTML and CSS files are located [here](https://github.com/AndreaRene/Module_1_Challenge/tree/main/Refactored_Code). Some of the steps I took to resolve the issues are as follows:

* Provided a unique title and description meta to make the website stand out on SERPs.
* Removed/replaced div elements in HTML code with more semantic elements including header, main, nav, and aside.
* added alt attributes to images in the main body of the page to provide more accessibility to users utilizing screen readers.
* Consolidated CSS selectors and properties by adding/changing classes/ids in elements with repeated styling.
* Utilized classes and ids that would support/withstand future alterations and additions to the page.
* Added commentation to CSS file.
* Fixed broken link in HTML.
