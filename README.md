# UTAB Module 1 Challenge 

In this project I was tasked with refactoring HTML and CSS code. The user story and acceptance criteria are as follows: 

User Story:

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

Acceptance Criteria: 

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Starter Code

The HTML and CSS starter files which were provided are located [here](https://github.com/AndreaRene/Module_1_Challenge/tree/main/Starter_Code).

* The starter HTML code was missing numerous semantic elements and was not optimized for accessibility. 
* The CSS code had repeating selectors and properties which needed to be consildated and organized. 
* The webpage had a broken link which needed to be fixed.

### Refactoring

My refactored HTML and CSS files are located [here](https://github.com/AndreaRene/Module_1_Challenge/tree/main/Refactored_Code).

* Removed/replaced div elements in HTML code with more semantic elements including header, main, nav, and article.
* Consolidated CSS selectos and properties by adding/changing classes/ids in elements with repeated styling.
* Added commentation to CSS file.
* Fixed broken link in HTML.


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
