# UTAB Module 1 Challenge 

In this project I was tasked with refactoring HTML and CSS code. The user story and acceptance criteria are as follows: 

User Story:

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

Acceptance Criteria: 

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Starter Code

The HTML and CSS starter code which were provided are located (url).

The starter HTML code was missing numerous semantic elements and was not optimized for accessibility. The CSS code had repeating selectors and properties which needed to be consildated and organized. 

Finally, the webpage had a broken link which needed to be fixed.

### Refactoring




### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
